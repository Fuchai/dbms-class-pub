/**

* Deanna's little talk introduction worked very well.
* Lead-follow individual practice is the best way to kickstart.
* There are many cute girls in the newcomers.
* Could not really hear Matt talk from this corner. But Deanna was very
* systematic.
* With music, some people could not catch up. It's okay. Just keep pushing them.
* Girls learn better than boys. Partnering up, the girls should back lead the boys.
* Not a bad habit in the beginning, imo.
* The separate practices near the end gave a good sense of success to
* all the newcomers, which is honestly the best thing to do since it's pre-audition era now. 
* But doing it in partnership is another matter.
